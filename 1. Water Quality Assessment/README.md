# Product Description
The final product is an USV, unmanned surface vehicle. It is developed as an autonomous boat which has the sensors embedded to it. The IoT, USV and Data Analytics have all been clubbed together to
build a product which is affordable as well as a technically competent and efficient. The boat, USV, now can hover and get the water quality parameters in seconds. The data can be used to arrive at a stronger insight and prediction. The pH and Temperature sensors are used in the version the team has built which collects the data and pushes it to cloud. Immediate processing happens and in seconds one could get the stats about the water.

# How are we different? What value do we add?

The system does not take one drop of water against the traditional techniques where we waste a lot of water. Here, we take data and not water. The system has evolved from the time the contest was announced. The versions are presented as a screenshot below. One can understand that the system is solid and can run against all sort of water turbidity. One more version for testing the overhead tanks at home is also built and is presented as well. The boat is tested many times to check its functioning and the amount of data we can give the concerned is really huge with lot of predictions and insights.

# Conclusion
To make it simple, we could measure the accurate water quality parameters with ease and accurate. This would greatly help the government or the concerned party to act accordingly to improve the quality through necessary actions. Also, the entire process is real-time and there is no delay. More importantly, the usage of the USV is simple and compact. It will not require a lot of learning or practice. The USV is inexpensive compared to traditional techniques. The product is smart and it gets the water better, clearer, and more usable.
